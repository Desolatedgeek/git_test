# git_test
Hello Odin! This is a test from Raymond. 

Second test from linux on VMware. The only issue that I face here is the supportability of the mouse which causes slow navigation. Other than that, the speed of the vmware is fast. I think i will use this when i have a laptop, instead of dual booting.
